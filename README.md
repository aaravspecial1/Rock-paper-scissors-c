# ðŸŽ® Snake Water Gun (C Game)

A simple console-based Snake Water Gun game written in C, where you play against the computer.

Iâ€™ve been learning C through online resources like [CodeWithHarry](https://www.codewithharry.com/), and this is one of my early practice projects.  
ðŸ’¬ **Feel free to leave suggestions or ideas â€” Iâ€™m always looking to improve and learn more!**

1. Make sure you have a C compiler (like GCC).
2. Open the terminal or command prompt in the folder.
3. Compile and run the game with:
